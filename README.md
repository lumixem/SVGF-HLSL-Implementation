# SVGF-HLSL-Implementation

This repo contains HLSL shaders for an implementation of Nvidia's [Spatiotemporal Variance-Guided Filtering](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-07_spatiotemporal-variance-guided-filtering-real-time-reconstruction-path-traced) paper.

The implementation was developed by [Andrei Bazzaev](https://andreibazzaev.systeme.io/portfolio) and myself as part of our 3rd year university project - [On The Bubble](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707350/On_the_Bubble/)
